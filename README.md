# flybrains
Transforms to map between different _Drosophila_ template brains.

This library is analogous to Greg Jefferis'
[nat.templatebrains](https://github.com/natverse/nat.templatebrains),  
[nat.jrcbrains](https://github.com/natverse/nat.jrcbrains) and
[nat.flybrains](https://github.com/natverse/nat.flybrains) for R.

`flybrains` ships with meta data and surface meshes for 17 template brains.

It's highly recommended that after install you download the optional
bridging registrations. _If you already have downloaded these registrations_
_via `nat.jrcbrains` and/or `nat.flybrains` you can skip this: `flybrains`_
_should be able to find the registrations downloaded via R and register_
_them for you._.

```Python
>>> import flybrains

# This downloads (or updates) various CMTK bridging and mirror transforms
# generated or collated by the Jefferis lab - see docstring for details
>>> flybrains.download_jefferislab_transforms()

# This downloads h5 bridging transforms generated by the Saalfeld lab (Janelia)
# - see docstring for details
>>> flybrains.download_saalfeldlab_transforms()

```

In the future, simply importing `flybrains` is sufficient to make the
transforms available to [navis](https://navis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```Python
>>> import navis
>>> import flybrains
>>> import numpy as np
>>> points = np.array([[0, 0, 0]])
>>> navis.xform_brain(points, source='FAFB', target='JRC2018F')

```

On import of `flybrains`, these data sources are injected into
 and can be readily used
to e.g. transform 3d coordinates between brain spaces.
