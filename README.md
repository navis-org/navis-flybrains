# navis-flybrains
Transforms to map between different _Drosophila_ template brains. Intended to be used with [navis](https://github.com/schlegelp/navis).

This library is analogous to Greg Jefferis' [nat.templatebrains](https://github.com/natverse/nat.templatebrains), [nat.jrcbrains](https://github.com/natverse/nat.jrcbrains) and [nat.flybrains](https://github.com/natverse/nat.flybrains) for R.

`flybrains` ships with:

- meta data + surface meshes for 22 template brains and nerve cords
- an Elastix transform between `FANC` and `JRCVNC2018F` kindly shared by Jasper Phelps
- a landmark-based transform between `MANC` and `FANC`
- mirror transforms for `FAFB14` and `FANC`

There are plenty additional transforms that need to be downloaded separately (see below).

## Installation
You can install `flybrains` from PyPI:

```bash
pip3 install flybrains
```

To install the dev version from Github:
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/navis-org/navis-flybrains.git
```

### External dependencies
In order to use the Jefferis lab or VFB transforms, you will need to have
[CMTK](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cmtk/) installed.

For the FANC to JRCVNC2018F transform, you will need to download
[elastix](https://elastix.lumc.nl/index.php) and make sure that the path
to the binaries is in your `PATH` variable.

## Usage

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/schlegelp/navis-flybrains/blob/main/_static/bridging_graph.png?raw=true" width="800">
</p>

It's highly recommended that after install, you download the (optional)
bridging transforms to map between template brains/nerve cords.

**IMPORTANT**: the URL for the JRC2018F <-> JRC2018M transform (`JRC2018U_JRC2018M.h5`)
was incorrect in `flybrains` version `0.2.6`. If you downloaded it using that
version of flybrains you need to manually remove the file, update flybrains and
download again using a newer version.

> :exclamation: If you already have downloaded these registrations via `nat.jrcbrains` and/or `nat.flybrains` you can skip this: `flybrains` should be able to find the registrations downloaded via R and register them for you (see also code at the bottom).

```Python
>>> import flybrains

# This downloads (or updates) various CMTK bridging and mirror transforms
# generated or collated by the Jefferis lab - see docstring for details
>>> flybrains.download_jefferislab_transforms()

# This downloads H5 bridging transforms between JRC brain templates
# (Saalfeld lab, Janelia Research Campus) - see docstring for details
>>> flybrains.download_jrc_transforms()

# This downloads H5 bridging transforms between JRC VNC templates
# (Saalfeld lab, Janelia Research Campus) - see docstring for details
>>> flybrains.download_jrc_vnc_transforms()

# This downloads (or updates) various CMTK bridging and mirror transforms
# generated or collated by VirtualFlyBrain.org - see docstring for details
>>> flybrains.download_vfb_transforms()

# Register the transforms - this is only necessary if you just downloaded them
# Alternatively just restart your Python session and import flybrains
>>> flybrains.register_transforms()
```

In the future, simply importing `flybrains` is sufficient to make the
transforms available to [navis](https://navis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```Python
>>> import navis
>>> import flybrains
>>> import numpy as np
>>> points = np.array([[429536, 205240,  38400]])
>>> navis.xform_brain(points, source='FAFB', target='JRC2018F')
array([[241.53969657, 100.99399233,  35.96977733]])
```

Please see the [transform tutorial](https://navis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/tutorials/transforming.html)
for `navis` to learn how to transform more complex data.

To check which transforms are available (either downloaded or via R) you can
run this:

```Python
>>> # Generate a report - note the mix of transforms downloaded via Python and R
>>> flybrains.report()

Meta data and surface meshes for the template brains/VNCs are readily accessible:

```Python
>>> flybrains.FAFB14
Template brain
--------------
Name: Full Adult Fly Brain
Short Name: FAFB14
Type: None
Sex:  female
Dimensions: 165372 x 80745 x 6730 voxels
Voxel size:
  x = 4 nanometers
  y = 4 nanometers
  z = 40 nanometers
Bounding box (nanometers):
  x = 192200, y = 75853, z = 2007,
  x = 853686, y = 398832, z = 271205,
Description: SSTEM volume comprising an entire female Drosophila brain was imaged at
 4x4x40nm by Zheng et al. (2018) and is availabe for download at
https://temca2data.org/. The meta data and associated mesh represent
version 14 (FAFB14) of this data set.
DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2018.06.019
```

Most templates come with a mesh e.g. for plotting via navis:

```Python
>>> flybrains.FAFB14.mesh
<trimesh.Trimesh(vertices.shape=(25047, 3), faces.shape=(50416, 3))>
>>> # You can pass the template object directly to navis' plotting functions
>>> navis.plot3d(flybrains.FAFB14)
```
