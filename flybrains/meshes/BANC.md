The BANC meshes (whole brain and brain/vnc neuropils) were downloaded from `precomputed://gs://lee-lab_brain-and-nerve-cord-fly-connectome/region_outlines`. Please see (Bates, Phelps, Kim, Yang _et al._, 2025)[https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.31.667571] for details.

The whole-brain mesh was additionally downsampled ~ 3x to reduce file size.
